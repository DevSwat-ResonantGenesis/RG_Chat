Tool Router Training Data
============================

High-quality labeled examples for training the neural tool classifier.
Each example is a (message, context, correct_tool) triple.

Context format: list of recent messages as dicts with "role" and "content".
Tool "none" means general chat — no tool needed.

This is the SEED dataset. Real user interactions are collected via active
learning and merged during periodic retraining.

Expanded Apr 2026 from 13 skills to 196 tools from RG_Unified_Tool_Registry.
